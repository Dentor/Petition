		<h2>Why this petition matters</h2>
<p><strong>As faculty and employees at CU, we strongly support the following statement:</strong></p>
<p>Sign condemning the antisemitic, biased, and fake-based evidence of the CU Boulder's “Department of Ethnic Studies Revised Palestine Support <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/ethnicstudies/2023/10/23/department-ethnic-studies-revised-palestine-support-statement" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="corgi-1ct102y">Statement</a>.”</p>
<p>CU Department of Ethnic Studies calls for the annihilation of the state of Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The Department of Ethnic Studies (ESD) Revised Palestine Support Statement published on 10.22.2023 is a disgrace to any liberal, peace advocate and human rights activist, as it calls&nbsp; “to support complete liberation, de-occupation, decarceration, and decolonization of Palestine”, which is totally erroneous and has no implication other than the annihilation of the State of Israel and the denial of&nbsp; its right to exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CU-ESD statement is biased and based on lies and fake evidence&nbsp;<br>The ESD statement proclaims that “starting October 7, 2023, over two years later we witness another unprecedented genocidal attack on the Palestinian people, an intentional collective punishment and forced displacement with unprecedented levels of air bombings on civilians”. This is at best an inexcusable and immoral apologism for Hamas that intentionally omits the key detail: namely, that on October 7th Hamas (acting as Gaza’s government) perpetrated a well-planned massacre. A massacre where Hamas tortured, raped, burned alive, beheaded, otherwise murdered, and kidnapped those Israelis and non-Israelis they could find that day in Israel. These atrocities were filmed and published by Hamas itself. Israel responded, as any sane nation will, by protecting its citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We write with the knowledge that it is not just Israeli that suffer from Hamas; that Hamas has denied the people of Gaza free elections since 2007 and has instituted a religiously totalitarian grifter state which brooks no dissent and misdirects hundreds of millions of foreign aid away from humanitarian purposes towards Hamas’ genocidal aims.</p>
<p>Had ESD done even a basic review of history, Hamas policies, the facts on the ground, and norms, it would have known the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>That the Jews of Israel are not colonizers but in fact the indigenous people returning to their homeland after suffering persecutions for 2000 years, not to mention the Holocaust;</li>
<li>That contrary to being an Apartheid State there is no discrimination in Israel law towards minorities: there are Arabs, muslims, christians and druze in Israel, participating in all society circle including in the Knesset (the parliament);</li>
<li>That Hamas is hostile towards women, other religions, LGBTQ communities, and the press;</li>
<li>That contrary to suffering genocide, the Arab population in Gaza and the West Bank has significantly increased since 1948;</li>
<li>That Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005 and is not occupying it;</li>
<li>That Hamas intentionally bases its military operations in residential areas and uses Gazans as human shields; and, most importantly,</li>
<li>That Israel’s efforts to eliminate the terrorist organization of Hamas is entirely consistent with international norms.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of academic rigor, ESD chose to disseminate cliched and inaccurate racist propaganda which effectively calls for the annihilation of the State of Israel. It did so with the CU Boulder letterhead. This Statement is inconsistent with CU Boulder’s claimed values of opposing racism and supporting tolerance and inclusion. As such, we, the undersigned, demand that CU Boulder’s administration conduct an immediate investigation into how the deceiving Hamas talking points could have been spread by one of its departments and under its letterhead. We also demand that CU take appropriate actions as determined by the results of such investigation.&nbsp;</p>
